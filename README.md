## Instructions
First, navigate to [https://aidan-walsh.github.io/COS426Project/](https://aidan-walsh.github.io/COS426Project/). Your goal is to score as many points as possible. To do so, different shapes will appear and slowly fall. As they fall, use the keys to move and rotate them. When you fill a layer full of blocks, the layer vanishes and you get points! Here are the controls: 
- Q/W/E = Rotation
- Arrow Keys = Shift
- Space Bar = Shift Down
- P = Pause
- 0 = Sandbox Mode
- 1/2/3 = Toggle Difficulty
- Mouse Click = Move Camera

When your game ends, hit the spacebar to restart!
